Tabs for indentation; no multi-tab nesting in signatures, calls, lists, or dicts.
Single quotes only (including docstrings).
Avoid `continue` statements in loops.
Prefer a single return per function.
Maintain correct indentation.
Align grouped imports and assignments vertically with at least one space around operators and after keywords.
For dicts/kwargs with multiple `=` entries, align the `=` vertically.
Inside output statements when mentioning code elements, wrap code elements in backticks.
Single line comments appear to the right of code, with at least two spaces before the `#` and arranged in a column.
Always a space after `#` in comments, including separator lines.
No trailing whitespace.
Imports are grouped into standard library, third-party, and local application/library sections, each separated by a blank line.
Two lines before class definitions and after imports; one line before method definitions.
Each method (except __init__) is preceded by a comment block consisting of two lines:
  - A capitalized descriptive line starting with the method's purpose.
  - A separator line of one space and 70 hyphens.
Except __init__, every method must include the two-line comment block above.
__init__ methods must not have the two-line comment block.
After imports, insert exactly two blank lines before the first class or function.
Between methods inside a class, insert exactly one blank line.
Never use more than one consecutive blank line elsewhere (except the required two before the first class/function).
Class methods arranged in the following order:
  - Initializer, magic methods
  - Private methods
  - Public methods
Private and Public method groups are preceded by three line comments of:
  - A line of one space and 70 equal signs
  - A descriptive line starting with "PRIVATE" or "PUBLIC"
  - A line of one space and 70 equal signs
Each file ends with a newline.
Each python file starts with a comment block:
  - A separator line of one space and 70 equal signs.
  - A brief description of the file's purpose, inner functional.
  - A separator line of one space and 70 equal signs.

Always a space after '#' in comments. Even in separator lines.
Each comment starts with a capitalized letter.
Only one empty line between functions and methods. Not more, not less.
Two empty lines between classes. Not more, not less.

Method groups:
MAGIC METHODS
PRIVATE METHODS
PUBLIC METHODS

In that order, verbatum in comments between equal-sign-lines. ALLCAPS.
No other groups must be present.
Skip MAGIC METHODS if only __init__ is in the group.
Skip group comment if group is empty.
Predicates come first within a group.

No caps in variable and method names
No ALLCAPS abbreviations in class names. I.e. DBManager becomes DbManager.
One class per file. File name is snake cased class name. ALWAYS.

Each method must be dedicated to a CLEAR and SINGLE purpose.
If name needs to have more than 3 words in description or should contain expression like "or" or "if" – method must be refactored or unnecessary.
